# Lab 03 
Today we're going to use PWM to fade an LED. 

**Playing with fades**

* Go here and build this circuit. Try typing the code yourself: 
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Fade 

Solder this circuit to perfboard. It should only be 1 resistor and 1 led and to wires you can plug into your arduino. It's an easy first soldering task, basically, replace the breadboard with a soldering iron. 

Take a short video to submit of the working circuit. 

**Voltage Dividers**
Hook up a potentometer. See last week's circuits if you don't remember how to do so. Using a multimeter, measure the change of voltage as you watch the knob change. This is for you. 

No documentation required but it's a fun thing to try out.



**Making a dark detecting LED (BREADBOARD ME!)** (for next week due to a part not arriving) 
Together, we are going to build this project to better understand transistors

[Here's the datasheet for the phototransistor] 
(https://www.avnet.com/shop/emea/products/everlight/pt333-3c-3074457345634369228?&r=EMEA&CMP=AVNET-EMEA-PPC-Google-All-English-AVE14-SKU-1699305114-66248026957-042019|mkwid|skycZlOwT_dc|pcrid|339939286074|pkw|pt333-3c|pmt|p|slid||prd||pgrid|66248026957|ptaid|kwd-14750612769)

There is one change though, verses use a battery, we're just going to power our circuit with the Arduino 3V out. 

Take a short video to submit of the working circuit.
