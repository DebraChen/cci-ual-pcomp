### Introduction

Letâ€™s build! In this unit. You will create controllers for playful experiences, take toys apart to explore their fuzzy innards in search of the mysteries there in and most importantly, have fun with electricity. 

How can we build playful worlds, tell stories, explore environments and create experiences? These are the goals of this class. In this lab, students will find a range of strange contraptions. We will explore basic physics, electronics, programming and software engineering. The practical objective of this course is the development of the skills needed for designing and building interactive physical devices with sensors, microcontrollers, motors, and more. Students will learn to fabricate installations and works of art.

#### Indicative Content 

* Design a physical computing system which includes electronics, sensors and actuators
    
* Implement a circuit from a diagram to create a circuit board
* Use basic electronic and fabrication tools such as but not limited to soldering irons, multimeters, oscilloscopes, CNC machines, 3D printers and laser cutters
* Write embedded software for a micro-controller
    Create wearable wireless interfaces

#### On completion of this unit you will be able to:

* Demonstrate an awareness of working with electronics and interactive sensors and actuators (Knowledge)
* Demonstrate a fundamental grasp of embedded computing (Knowledge)
* Create works of art using physical computing technology (Process)
* Demonstrate a familiarly with modern fabrication techniques and tools (Knowledge)
* Evaluate a physical computing system from an engineering or an artistic perspective. (Enquiry)

Assessment Requirements

### Portfolio of work: 
Documenting the outcomes for the set project including an original work of art using physical computing and fabrication techniques. This will also include a research weblog documenting iterative design and development process specifically in the areas of physical computing. (100%)
(for more, please see [portfolio_of_work.md] (portfolio_of_work.md) 

For more information about how your assignments are marked, please go to section 4.0: assessment. You will receive an assignment brief, which will give you more detail.

Teaching and Learning Methods

To enable you to demonstrate achievement against the learning outcomes, the subject will be introduced through a range of studio-based workshops and assignments supported where appropriate by lectures, seminars, critiques and visits.
