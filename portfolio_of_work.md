Assessment Requirements

### Assessment: 
Portfolio of work: documenting the outcomes for the set project including an original work of art using physical computing and fabrication techniques. This will also include a research weblog documenting iterative design and development process specifically in the areas of physical computing. (100%)

### Portfolio of Work Notes 
Each week you will have labs. In your portfolio of work you should document them the following way: 
* a photo of the circuit 
* a short video of it working (10-30 sec) 
* a 25-50 words about what you learned

The labs will need to be submitted as pdf at the end

During the final four weeks of the unit, each student should make a creative work of art which uses electronics and has an interface (a way to interact with it).  

### Creative Work
At the end of class, we will present our creative work in class.

You should also document them in your pdf, after your labs.

Add the following: 

* a circuit diagram
* any code you have programed your microcontroller (you can cut and paste it in or include a link, whichever you prefer)
* two photos of the completed project
* a link to a short (10-40 seconds) video of it work.
