### Week 01 - the basics 
* An overview of we are learning. 
* Fundamentals of electricity 
* The Design of Everyday Things Chapter 1 

#### Reading 
Chapter 1 of The Design of Everyday Things 
 
#### Lab 
Do the first 2 exercises from the lab book pdf I will place on the slack. These are not required but they are encouraged to enable you to do the homework. 

#### Homework 
Get playful with buttons and LEDS. Make a simple timing game such as Simon Says with at least 3 levels and a clear start and end. Have 3 buttons for interaction and make it so you press the first botton to start the game. When the game is over, all 3 LEDS should come on and stay in until the start button is pressed again. If you have an idea for a better game, give it a go. I'm open to you editing these briefs. 

### Portfolio of Work Notes 
Each week you will have labs. In your portfolio of work you should document them the following way: 
* a photo of the circuit 
* a short video of it working (10-30 sec) 
* a 25-50 words about what you learned

If you get stuck bring it in for the following week.
