# Week 02 - Sensors, knobs, and Serial Data 

*Class will Start with a review and reading discussion - Archeologies of Haptics & The Design of Everyday Things*

*Lecture - See slides Week02.pdf* 
### Lab 00 - Leds in Serial and Parallel 

Answer the following questions: 

How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in serial before running out of voltage? 

How many leds can you hook up with a 220k resistor in parallel before running out of voltage? 
  
### Lab 01 - Serial Data
Using the hello sketch, play with the serial monitor( In the Arduino menu Tools>Serial Monitor) to tell a wee story based on player input. It can be around 3 lines long.  

### Lab 02 - Potentiometers (Knobs) 
 
Hook up a knob and have it change the brightness of an LED

### Lab 03 - Light Dependent Resistors 
Hook up an LDR. Try making the LED change brightness depending on the light level.

### Lab 04 - Playing with Common Sensors  

Working in groups of 4, pick one of the below sensors. Hook it up and be prepared to explain to the class how to works.
