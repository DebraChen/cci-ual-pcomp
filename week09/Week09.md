# Week 09 - Eagle 

[Eagle](https://www.autodesk.co.uk/products/eagle/free-download) is a tool used for circuit board layout. It is not the only one. There is also [KiCad](http://www.kicad-pcb.org/), [DipTrace](https://diptrace.com/), and dozens of others.

Why Eagle? 
* easy to use 
* free educational license through Autodesk 
* large number of parts 
* Autodesk has yet to destroy it but they seem happily about the task with their feature creep. Eagle use to be hands down the best but since the Autodesk merger, I've been considering moving back to KiCad. 

Why KiCad? 

* super hip
* open source and free forever 
* lots of parts
* takes an investment of time to use 
* making your own parts is easier 
* [a good tutorial](http://blog.oshpark.com/2019/10/16/getting-to-blinky-with-kicad-5/) 

Why DipTrace?

* Very pro much meow (900+ Pounds meow) 
* Some people really love it 
* Popular among many EEs
* More pro features 

Great PCB Resource 
* [London Hackspace Wiki](https://wiki.london.hackspace.org.uk/view/Guides/PCB_Fabrication)

Where to print PCBs that I like and have used? 

UK 
* [Ragworm](https://ragworm.eu/)

EU / UK
* [Aisler](https://aisler.net/)

US 
* [OHS Park](https://oshpark.com/)

China and good, just slow 
* [Dirty PCB](https://dirtypcbs.com/store/pcbs)

Got time and money and want the best pro boards you can afford in mass? They even have an assembly service.
